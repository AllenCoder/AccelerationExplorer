AccelerationExplorer
====================

Discover your Android devices acceleration sensor! Acceleration Explorer allows users to investigate the noise, offset and skew associated with the accelerometer sensor on Android devices. After a quick calibration process, Acceleration Explorer will calculate the magnitude of each axis and the noise associated with it. Acceleration Explorer also determines the minimum and maximum amplitudes of each axis along with the update frequency of the acceleration sensor.
