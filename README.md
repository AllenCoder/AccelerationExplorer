====================

Acceleration Explorer is an open source Android application that plots the acceleration sensor outputs in real-time. The acceleration sensor outputs can also be logged to a .CSV file and be opened in any spreedsheet application. This allows the user to record the acceleration of any object the Android device is attached to. Analog gauges of the magnitude of the acceleration and rotation of the device are also displayed to help further visualize the acceleration sensor outputs.

In addition to the plotting and logging capabilities, Acceleration Explorer has a diagnostic mode intended to help the user discover the noise, offset and skew associated with the acceleration sensor. After a quick calibration process, Acceleration Explorer will calculate the magnitude, accuracy and noise of each axis of the sensor. Acceleration Explorer also determines the minimum and maximum amplitudes of each axis along with the update frequency of the acceleration sensor. This can be very useful for developers and other interested parties that need to compare the performance of acceleration devices equipped on different devices. It can also be useful in determining what digital filters and other calibrations might help the acceleration sensor to improve the sensors performance and accuracy.

Acceleration Explorer Features:

* Plots the output of all of the sensors axes in real-time
* Log the output of all of the sensors axes to a .CSV file
* Visualize the magnitude and direction of the acceleration
* Visualize the tilt of the device
* Measure the acceleration sensors frequency, offset and noise
* Compare the performance of multiple devices
